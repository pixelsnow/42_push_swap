# 42_push_swap

ðŸš§ In progress ðŸš§

## Summary

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using, the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

## The rules
- You have 2 stacks named a and b.
- At the beginning:
  - The stack **a** contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
  - The stack **b** is empty.
- The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal:
  - **sa** (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  - **sb** (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
  - **ss** : sa and sb at the same time.
  - **pa** (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
  - **pb** (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
  - **ra** (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
  - **rb** (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
  - **rr** : ra and rb at the same time.
  - **rra** (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
  - **rrb** (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
  - **rrr** : rra and rrb at the same time.
